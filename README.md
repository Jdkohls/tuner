## Album Art (experimental)

The option to show the song Album Art is disabled by default, here's how to 
enable it:

First install [Ãœberzug](https://github.com/seebye/ueberzug) 
(on Arch Linux, install the `ueberzug` package)...

Then open Tuner and type `/a` in the search bar and restart your Terminal and 
Tuner.

## MPRIS

In version `v0.0.1`, Tuner used mpris to comunicate with MPV. In newer version
Tuner uses libmpv instead. You can enable mpris by running the command `/mpris`.
The script file should be placed at `~/.config/mpv/scripts/mpris.so`.

If you installed the package `mpv-mpris-git` from the AUR, you need to copy the
file `/usr/share/mpv/scripts/mpris.so` to `~/.config/mpv/scripts/mpris.so`.
